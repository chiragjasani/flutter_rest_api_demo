# rest_api_flutter

There are a few steps that we can follow to easily integrate an API into our Flutter app:

Step 1: Get the API URL and endpoints.

Step 2: Add relevant packages into the app (http, dio, chopper, etc.).

Step 3: Create a constant file that stores URLs and endpoints.

Step 4: Create a model class to parse the JSON.

Step 5: Create a file that handles the API call, and write specific methods to fetch and parse data.

Step 6: Use the data in your app.
